{"body":"## CodeMontage Resources\r\n\r\nWelcome! Here's where we keep track of references, tips, and tricks that help us improve our coding skills through social good projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n### CodeMontage Core Principles\r\n\r\n* Computing is among the most efficient and effective ways to improve the human experience.\r\n* Open Source Software advances our collective human progress. (We don't believe TMI exists in software, and will try to share and open source as much as possible).\r\n* Engaging diverse contributors is essential to improving the software industry, and thus the impact of computing on humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n### About Us\r\nThese resources are maintained by the @CodeMontage team, founded in 2012 and led by @DBNess.
