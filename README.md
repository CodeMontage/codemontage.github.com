## CodeMontage Resources

Welcome! Here's where we keep track of references, tips, and tricks that help us improve our coding skills through social good projects.


### CodeMontage Core Principles

* Computing is among the most efficient and effective ways to improve the human experience.
* Open Source Software advances our collective human progress. (We don't believe TMI exists in software, and will try to share and open source as much as possible).
* Engaging diverse contributors is essential to improving the software industry, and thus the impact of computing on humanity.


### Setting up this site locally

We'd love for your help making CodeMontage a better place to code to change the world!* 

This site is built using [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). To get started, we recommend [the jekyll-bootstrap tutorial](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html) and [the jekyll docs](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki)

* Install Ruby (1.9+, ideally)
* Install the Jekyll gem ('gem install jekyll')
* [Fork and Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* In your local repo, run 'jekyll --server' and checkout http://localhost:4000

*We ask that your contributions remain consistent with our core principles (above), and that you make sure to feel warm and fuzzy afterward, since helping out is really, really cool of you.
